    <h3>Master Foo and the Script Kiddie</h3>

    <p>A stranger from the land of Woot came to Master Foo as he was eating the morning meal with his students.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I hear y00 are very l33t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Pl33z teach m3 all y00 know.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Master Foo&apos;s students looked at each other, confused by the stranger&apos;s barbarous language. Master Foo
        just smiled and replied: &ldquo;You wish to learn the Way of Unix?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I want to b3 a wizard hax0r,&rdquo; the stranger replied, &ldquo;and 0wn ever3one&apos;s b0xen.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I do not teach that Way,&rdquo; replied Master Foo.</p>

    <p>The stranger grew agitated. &ldquo;D00d, y00 r nothing but a p0ser,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If y00 n00 anything,
        y00 wud t33ch m3.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There is a path,&rdquo; said Master Foo, &ldquo;that might bring you to wisdom.&rdquo; The master
        scribbled an IP address on a piece of paper. &ldquo;Cracking this box should pose you little difficulty, as
        its guardians are incompetent. Return and tell me what you find.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The stranger bowed and left. Master Foo finished his meal.</p>

    <p>Days passed, then months. The stranger was forgotten.</p>

    <p>Years later, the stranger from the land of Woot returned.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I cracked that box, and it was easy like you said. But I got busted by
        the FBI and thrown in jail.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Master Foo. &ldquo;You are ready for the next lesson.&rdquo; He scribbled an IP address
        on another piece of paper and handed it to the stranger.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;<i>Are you crazy?</i>&rdquo; the stranger yelled. &ldquo;After what I&apos;ve been through, I&apos;m never
        going to break into a computer again!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Master Foo smiled. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the beginning of wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>On hearing this, the stranger was enlightened.</p>
